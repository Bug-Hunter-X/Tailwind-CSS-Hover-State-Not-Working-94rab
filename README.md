# Tailwind CSS Hover State Issue

This repository demonstrates a problem where Tailwind CSS hover states are not working as expected.  A button should change color on hover, but it does not.

## Problem
The hover state for the background color is not applied.  The provided code includes a div element with Tailwind CSS classes intended to change the background color on hover, but the hover effect does not occur.

## Solution
The solution involves ensuring that the correct Tailwind directives are included and that there are no conflicting styles or CSS overrides preventing the hover state from being applied. The solution also provides an example showing how to debug similar issues.
